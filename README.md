# Separate Collection Calendar

This project is a PHP application that can help families and others keep track of the days of the week when recycling takes place.

# First step

As soon as the application opens, there will be a small form that will immediately ask for "username" and "password".
If the user is already registered he will log in immediately, if he is the first log in he will be automatically registered in the database.

# Second step

As soon as the user is logged in, he will be presented with a calendar that marks the current day in "red" color, if instead an event is scheduled for the current day, the day will be in "green" color and the type will be shown on the screen of event.

# Third step

The user will have at his disposal a legend, which through a number and a color identifies the type of waste:
1.Plastic
2.Glass
3.Paper
4.Humid
5.Dry

# Fourth step 

The user can do three things on the calendar:
*Enter the event

*Delete the event

*Edit the event

# Fifth step

More than one event can be entered in a day.
